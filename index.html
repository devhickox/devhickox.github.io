<p>My name is Devyn Hickox and I am a sophomore at the University of Georgia. From the moment I toured
 the University of Georgia, I knew I wanted to go here. Coming to college is like starting your life over 
 from scratch. It is the most terrifying yet gratifying thing you will do in your young life. This is my 
 tribute to all of the seniors out there to know what they should expect. It all starts with moving in. 
 This is a very monumental moment in your life. You say goodbye to your friends, your family, and everything 
 you've ever known. But do not be scared! There is so much to be excited for! ! In this next year you will 
 experience so many new things and meet so many new people. To do freshman year right, 
there are definitely some guidelines you should follow. These are my tips for freshman year!</p>

<p> When you come to college, make sure you get involved. UGA is a massive school but getting involved in organizations around
campus is an amazing way to make it seem a lot smaller and to make a ton of friends. There is a wide array of areas you can get involved in. There 
are huge organizations on campus such as UGA miracle or Relay for Life where you can be part of something and make a difference
and there is also a club for everything you could think of. If there isn't a club for something you are interested, the University encourages you
to make one yourself. One amazing this about the University of Georgia is the incredible fan base. From the moment you decide to come to UGA, you
 are a dawg for the rest of your life. Win or lose, the dawgs always come together and support the teams. Freshman year I reccomend attending all
 of the games. This is a great way to meet new people and feel like you 
are part of something bigger than yourself. Every year before the football season starts, a hype video is 
released to get everyone excited. I definitely reccomend watching it to get you excited for the best 4 years
of your life.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih2A4BmA2E">UGA Hype Video</a> </p>

<p>The best thing about freshman year is it is a time to be yourself and experience things you never have
before. Do not be scared to talk to people and know everyone is in the same boat. Whether if you are from in 
state and know one hundred people or if you are from Alaska and know no one, everyone wants to make new friends
and everyone is new to this place. Also know that the transition might be difficult at the beginning and that is normal
too. I promise by the end of this year you will be so happy you made the decision to go here.Take time to talk to that
 girl sitting next to you on the bus or that boy in your Science class. These might end up being your new best friends! 
 Work hard in school but also really enjoy your freshman year. I can't tell you how much I wish I was a freshman again.
 You still have four years left at this amazing University. Enjoy it.</p>
